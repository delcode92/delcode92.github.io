Privacy Policy for Simple Calc

Last Updated: July 10, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how we handles information in connection with your use of the Simple Calc mobile application (the "App").
1. Information We Do Not Collect

Our primary goal is to provide a simple, efficient, and private calculator experience. The Simple Calc app does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from its users.

This means:

    We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.

    We do not collect information about your device, location, or usage patterns.

    We do not access your contacts, photos, microphone, camera, or any other sensitive data on your device.

    All calculations performed within the app are processed locally on your device and are not sent to any external servers.

2. No Third-Party Services

The Simple Calc app does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or other external services that could collect data from you.
3. No Cookies or Tracking Technologies

Since the app does not connect to the internet or collect any user data, it does not use cookies, web beacons, or any other tracking technologies.
4. Security

While we do not collect any personal data, we are committed to ensuring that your use of the App is secure and private. The App operates entirely offline, minimizing any potential security risks associated with data transmission.
5. Children's Privacy

Our App is intended for a general audience and is not specifically directed at children under the age of 13. Given that we do not collect any personal information, we inherently comply with children's privacy regulations.
6. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
